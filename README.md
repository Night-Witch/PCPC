Python & C# Password Cracker (PCPC)

Script Brute Force Password Cracker (Pyhon or c#)

Overview: This scripts is designed to perform a brute force attack on a web server's login page by iterating through all possible combinations of passwords. The script uses a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to generate potential passwords and attempts to log in with each one. This code uses the requests library to send POST requests to the server. If the server returns a response with the text 'Success' (or another indicator of success), the program outputs the successful password and terminates.

Functionality:

Password Generation: The script generates all possible combinations of characters (including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols) for a specified length. HTTP Requests: For each generated password, the script sends a POST request to the designated login URL with the username and password as parameters. Response Handling: It checks the server's response to determine whether the login attempt was successful. If a response contains the keyword "Success", the script will output the found password and terminate. Usage:

Set the URL: Modify the url variable to point to the login page of the target server. (Change url = "http://example.com/login" to the actual server address you want to test.)

Specify the Username: Change the username in the function call to match the account you are attempting to crack. (Replace "myusername" in the call to brute_force_password with the actual username for which you are trying to guess the password.)

Set Password Length: Adjust the password length parameter to control the complexity of the brute force attack. This code will iterate through all possible combinations of passwords of length 4 for the specified username. You can change the length by modifying the last parameter in the call to brute_force_password.

Run the Script: Execute the script in a Python environment, and it will attempt to find the correct password by brute force. (This code will iterate through all possible combinations of passwords of length 4 for the specified username. You can change the length by modifying the last parameter in the call to brute_force_password.)
