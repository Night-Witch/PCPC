Replace the URL: Change the line string url = "http://example.com/login"; to the actual URL of the login page of the target server.

Replace form fields: Ensure that the field names "username" and "password" match the actual field names used by the server to accept the username and password.

Set password length: You can adjust the password length by modifying the variable int passwordLength = 4;. This controls the number of characters in the generated passwords.

Run the program: Execute the program. It will iterate through all possible password combinations of the specified length and send them to the server until it finds the correct password.
